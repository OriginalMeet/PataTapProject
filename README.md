# PataTapProject

I have tried to mimic the PataTap website using HTML, CSS and Paper.js. On this website, if you press a laptop key then it will generate random circle animation with the sound associated with that key. I hope you enjoy my small project. Here is it's Link: https://originalmeet.github.io/PataTapProject/
